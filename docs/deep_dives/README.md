Purpose of deep_dives
- Hold detailed, text and image based context that supports decisions and implementation.
- Keep this folder optional; only create files when depth is helpful.

How to use
- Start each file with a 3–5 line summary and, if useful, a short status (Open | Accepted | Rejected | Parked).
- Keep sections short; link out to sources. Place images alongside the Markdown file using relative links.
- Reference deep dives from Tasks/Logs/commits when they influence work.
- Track the meaning and canonical links to deep dives in `docs/project_docs/project_structure.md` under a short “Deep Dives Index” section for navigation.

Notes
- Deep dives are not the primary source of truth for rules; Mission and Structure remain authoritative.
