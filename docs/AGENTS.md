# Workspace Agent Instructions

This repository uses the t-0 documentation framework. The authoritative docs live under `docs/framework_docs/`.

- Start with `FRAMEWORK_CONTRACT.md` and `AOP.md`.
- During each session, load and comply with `AGENT_OPERATING_PROCEDURE.md`.
- Refer to `FRAMEWORK_PHILOSOPHY.md` for judgment calls not covered elsewhere.

## Workspace specifics

- Project name: Project Collab Preview
- Primary docs location: `docs/`

## Mode and stop rules

Follow the AOP-defined mode detection and stop rules. If the framework is missing or incomplete, pause and ask to bootstrap or repair before proceeding.

## Logging
