Purpose
- Capture org/team-level rules that sit above a project while staying lightweight and editable. Workspace agent instructions (e.g., `AGENTS.md`) should reference this file when org policy is relevant.

Platform
- CI/CD platform(s): 
- Repository hosting: 

Security
- Handling of secrets: 
- Dependency/update policy: 

Optional: Tools & Policies
- If the org standardizes on certain tools or safety requirements, note them here. Keep details minimal and project-specific guidance in `project_stack.md`.
