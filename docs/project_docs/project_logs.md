## 2025-09-24T06Z — Added workspace agent template
- Type: Decision
- Context: Needed a bundled template so adopters create the workspace-level `AGENTS.md` required by the framework.
- Action: Added `docs/framework_docs/agents.template.md` with customization guidance and updated `docs/framework_docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` prerequisites to point to it.
- Why: Followed project_structure.md Directory Intent for `/docs/` to house framework docs and ensure onboarding steps call out the workspace entry point.
- Outcome: Template and setup guide now direct teams to copy/customize the workspace instructions when applying the framework.
- Refs: `docs/framework_docs/agents.template.md`, `docs/framework_docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md`
